# Acylote-alert
To change refresh rate change value in def start(): sleep(seconds) // default: (sleep(60)) 1minute </br>
If u want to use sound you have to type 'pip install playsound' in python console and place a wav sound file named 'alert_sound.wav' in same folder as script. </br>
To stop the sound press 'ctrl+c' </br>
For now it works only if 1 acylote is present
